This is a simple minecraft marketplace.

Even though I used PHP to build this project, it has no connection with DATABASE. All this project's data is
just simple arrays declared inside the php file.

This is another project of mine that is focused on design. The reason why I used PHP was just to include files(Header, Footer and etc)

To run this project type: php -S localhost:<port>
